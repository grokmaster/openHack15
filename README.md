<h3> What is this? </h3>
This is where most of the info about what we build goes...

<h3> Rule of the game </h3>
_Create an original, executable and relevant app, within 24 hours, that opens up our world: provides greater transparency, increases the sharing of information or opens social connections._
<h3> So, what are we building? </h3>
We have no idea...

<h3> If you want to collaborate... </h3>
